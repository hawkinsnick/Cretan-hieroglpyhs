# Cretan Hieroglyphic Open Corpus

## AI research skill

This corpus project includes a vendor-neutral, evidence-first AI research skill in [`ai-skill/`](ai-skill/). The corpus remains the scholarly source of truth; the skill is an interface to it, not a second corpus and not an independent authority.

Researchers using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another capable model can provide the repository (or its AI-ready bundle) together with [`ai-skill/SKILL.md`](ai-skill/SKILL.md). The skill requires the model to preserve provenance, uncertainty, exclusions, source dependence, rights, and this project's scientific gates. Before substantive use, check [`ai-skill/generated/source-state.json`](ai-skill/generated/source-state.json) and the generated research-bundle index for the corpus commit represented by the AI package.

For questions spanning multiple corpus projects, use the **Combined Corpus Research AI** documented in the Linear A repository under [`combined-ai-skill/`](https://github.com/hawkinsnick/Linear-A/tree/ai-skill-v0.1/combined-ai-skill). It orchestrates the registered individual skills while keeping their evidence models and rights separate. Membership in the combined system does **not** imply linguistic relationship, sign equivalence, chronology, decipherment, or independent replication.

## Current status — 5.3.0

Adds 234 source-attributed contextual assertions on 26 CHIC entries from 29 INSCRIBE catalogue pages; three unnumbered pages remain excluded source leads. All 331 identities have reproducible review dossiers. Script alternatives, unknown findspots and chronology qualifiers remain literal. Five readings on two objects and zero independent reviews remain unchanged.

Family contract 1.2 aligns all five projects with [Phaistos Disc 1.6.0](https://github.com/hawkinsnick/Phaistos-Disc/releases/tag/v1.6.0). The shared readiness report preserves native sampling units, source rights and blocked linguistic controls. It authorizes no pooling or linguistic relationship claim. See [`research/family-readiness-v1.json`](research/family-readiness-v1.json).

The authoritative current gate summary is [`analysis/current-status.json`](analysis/current-status.json). Historical release reports below retain their original versions and claims.

**5.0.0 — critical corpus production contract**

A provenance-first, source-critical and reproducible research corpus for Cretan Hieroglyphic.

5.0 turns the mature 4.x engineering platform into a stable production contract for inscription-level critical evidence. It adds exact-locator critical readings, source-access and redistribution controls, versioned corpus snapshots, explicit research boundaries and compatibility with the cross-project matched-information-environment protocol.

The foundation remains 331 CHIC catalogue-spine records and a 96-entry numbered core registry inside the broader multi-repertoire model. No native phonetic values are asserted. At the historical 5.0 baseline, critical readings, source-checked occurrences and independent reviews were zero. The current source-access pilot above adds readings while independent review remains pending.

**Blocked is a valid scientific result.** Internal structural analysis, CH–Linear A comparison and fine matched-degradation experiments remain blocked by their predeclared evidence requirements.


The shared family report now targets the Disc [2.0.0-rc.2 prerelease](https://github.com/hawkinsnick/Phaistos-Disc/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2). Final independently reviewed Disc 2.0 remains blocked; compatibility does not confer linguistic equivalence or independent review. Native evidence and this repository’s release version are unchanged.

### Research evidence workbench 1.0

Download the research workbench ZIP, extract it, and open [workbench/evidence.html](workbench/evidence.html). It includes searchable pinned evidence, coverage definitions and unverified inspection-note export. See the [reading and review guide](research/workbench-guide.md). This engineering milestone grants no independent epigraphic acceptance.

### Research workbench 1.1

Download the [research workbench 1.1 package](https://github.com/hawkinsnick/Cretan-hieroglpyhs/releases/tag/research-workbench-v1.1.0), extract it, and open `workbench/evidence.html`. It adds snapshot-bound inspection collections and includes the immutable release correction tracker. The Disc explorer also presents readable scenario comparisons. This engineering release grants no scientific acceptance.

## Context and review dossiers — 5.3.0

Adds 234 source-attributed contextual assertions on 26 CHIC entries from 29 INSCRIBE catalogue pages; three unnumbered pages remain excluded source leads. All 331 identities have reproducible review dossiers. Script alternatives, unknown findspots and chronology qualifiers remain literal. Five readings on two objects and zero independent reviews remain unchanged.

Read [the researcher guide](docs/CONTEXT-AND-DOSSIERS.md), [the coverage audit](analysis/context-coverage-v1.json) and [record dossiers](research/record-dossiers.json). Run `python scripts/research_dossiers.py` to check deterministic replay. Metadata coverage does not imply reading coverage or representative sampling.


## Offline corpus browser
Run `python scripts/build_corpus_browser.py` to generate `workbench/corpus-browser.html`. The browser uses only the explicit rights/provenance-reviewed allowlist in `research/browser-sources.json`, including the CHIC catalogue spine, context, critical readings, graph observations, core sign registry, disagreements and record dossiers. Never recursively ingest restricted/raw upstream material. Browser display does not establish decipherment, source independence or expert validation.
